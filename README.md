rTest
=====

rTest.py is a python based remote testing FrameWork. Use this program as your terminal console while coding in your favorite editor and running tests on any number of remote machines simultaneously. This program also maintains a sync between your local project directory and the remote directory so you don't have to worry about constantly SSH'ing into remote machines and running your code. Neither do you have to worry about transfering the files constantly because you have terminal editors. This program else enables you to send email alerts just in case you want to start a test and want to grab a quick bite. Your results can be sent to your email.
